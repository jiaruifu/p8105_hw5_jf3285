## Problem 1

``` r
set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))

replace_missing_values = function(x) {
  if (is.numeric(x)) {
    x=replace_na(x, mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))}
  else if (is.character(x)) {
    x=replace_na(x, "virginca")}
}

iris_new = map(iris_with_missing, replace_missing_values) 
as_tibble(iris_new)
```
